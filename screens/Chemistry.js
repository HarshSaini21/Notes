                <Text> Anything that has mass and takes up space is referred to as matter. hydrogen and oxygen, sugar and sand,
air and water, etc. Small, minuscule particles make up matter. Due to the space between them, matter
particles are attracted to one another.
States of Matter
• Matter can be classified as solid, liquid and gas on the basis of interparticle forces and the
arrangement of particles.
• These three forms of matter are interconvertible by increasing or decreasing pressure and
temperature. For example, ice can be converted from solid to a liquid by increasing the temperature.
